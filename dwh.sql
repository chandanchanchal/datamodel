What is Data Warehousing?
A Data Warehouse (DWH) is a system used for reporting and data analysis. It integrates data from multiple sources and stores historical data for business intelligence.

ðŸ”¹ Key Characteristics of a Data Warehouse:
âœ” Subject-Oriented â€“ Focuses on a specific business area (e.g., Travel).
âœ” Integrated â€“ Combines data from multiple sources.
âœ” Time-Variant â€“ Stores historical data.
âœ” Non-Volatile â€“ Data is read-only, not updated frequently.
